Python's syntax relies heavily on the use of whitespace. Individual statements are typically
concluded with a new line character, although a command can extend to another line, either
with a concluding backslash character (\), or if an opening delimiter has not yet been closed,
such as the { character in defining value_map.

Whitespace is also key in delimiting the bodies of control structures in Python. Specifically, a block
of code is indented to designate it as the body of a control structure, and nested control structures
use increasing amounts of indentation.

Comments are annotations provided for human readers, yet ignored by the Python interpreter. The primary syntax for comments in Python
is based on the use of # character, which designates the remainder of the line as a comment.
