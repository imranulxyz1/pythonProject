The Python Interpreter
Python is formally an interpreted language. Commands are executed through a piece of software
known as the Python interpreter. The interpreter receives a command, evaluates that command, and
reports the result of the command. While the interpreter can be used interactively, a programmer
typically stored in a file named with .py suffix

On most operating systems, the Python interpreter can be started by typing python from the command
line. By default, the interpreters starts in interactive mode with a clean workspace.
Commands from a predefined script saved in a file are executed by invoking the interpreter
with the filename as argument, or using an additional -i flag in order to execute a script
and then enter interactive mode.

Many integrated development environments (IDEs) provide richer software development platforms for
Python, including one named IDLE that is included with the standard Python distribution.
IDLE provides an embedded text-editor with support for displaying and editing Python code, and
a basic debugger, allowing step-by-step execution of a program while examining key variable values.
